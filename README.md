## Reference Implementation for Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs
  
This is a reference application that demonstrates how Cross-border APIs can be used for the supported transaction types. Please see here for details on the APIs: [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/). 
This application illustrates connecting to the cross-border APIs with / without encryption.
Both the approaches require consumer key and .p12 file as received from [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard).

### Frameworks / Libraries used
- [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) 5.1.x  
  
### Requirements
- Java 8 and above  
- Apache maven 3.5.x  
- Set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to match the location of your Java installation.  
  
### Setup  
- Create an account at [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/account/sign-up).  
- Create a new project and add `Mastercard Cross-Border Services` API to your project.   
- Configure project and download signing key. It will download the zip file.  
- Select .p12 file from zip and copy it to `src\main\resources` in the project folder.
- Open `[project folder]\src\main\resources\mastercard-api.properties` and configure below parameters.
    
    >**mastercard.api.environment.sandbox.endPointURL=http://sandbox.api.mastercard.com**, its a static field, will be used as a host to make API calls.
    
    >**mastercard.api.environment.sandbox.partnerId=SANDBOX_1234567**, this refers to partnerId of sandbox environment. This is a static field and need not be changed. If you wish, you can change it with your preferred partnerId.
    
    **Below properties will be required for authentication of API calls.**
    
    >**mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyFile=**, this refers to .p12 file found in the signing key. Please place .p12 file at src\main\resources in the project folder and add classpath for .p12 file.
    
    >**mastercard.api.authentication.consumerKey=**, this refers to your consumer key. Copy it from "Keys" section on your project page in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard)
      
    >**mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyalias=keyalias**, this is the default value of key alias. If it is modified, use the updated one from keys section in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard).
    
    >**mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.password=keystorepassword**, this is the default value of key alias. If it is modified, use the updated one from keys section in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard).
    
    **OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION**
    
    **Below properties will be required to encrypt / decrypt the request and response payloads. Contact APISupport@mastercard.com to get required keys and files for the same**
      
    >**mastercard.api.environment.runWithEncryptedPayload=false**, setting this field to true, will encrypt the request payload before sending the request. It will also return encrypted response.
    
    >**mastercard.api.encryption.certificateFile=**, this is the path to certificate (.crt) file. Add classpath for .crt file, after placing it at src\main\resources in the project folder.
    
    >**mastercard.api.encryption.fingerPrint=**, this is the encryption key, required to encrypt a request.
       
    >**mastercard.api.decryption.keyFile=**, this is the .key file, required to decrypt a request. Add classpath for .key file, after placing it at src\main\resources in the project folder.
      
### Build and Run

>**Note: To change the input passed to APIs, modify values in CrossBorderAPITestHelper.java**  

### Use cases
Main use cases in cross-border APIs are Quote, Payment, Retrieve payment and Cancel payment. Below are few variations.   
A] [Request a quote](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/quotes-api/):

Below are the different flavors available for a quote transaction:

> Case 1:  **FORWARD QUOTE WITH FEES INCLUDED** 
- Originating institute (OI) can make a forward quote request.  
- In case of forward quote with fees included, OI wants to specify the Sending amount and currency for a payment. Quotes response will provide the amount that will be received by beneficiary. 
e.g. If OI wants to send 100$, then amount received by beneficiary will be conversion of (100 $ - (fees)) in receiver currency.      
- Refer to #Usecase - 1 in [QuotesAPITest.java](./src\test\java\com\mastercard\crossborder\api\QuotesAPITest.java) for details.  

> Case 2:  **FORWARD QUOTE WITH FEES NOT INCLUDED**
- Originating institute (OI) can make a forward quote request with fees not included.  
- In case of forward quote with fees not included, OI will to specify the Sending amount and currency for a payment. Fees collected will be on top of what was requested to be paid. So OI will pay the fees but on top of initial amount.
- e.g. If OI wants to transfer 100$ to beneficiary then he will be asked to pay (100 $ + fees) and beneficiary will receive conversion of 100$ in receiving currency. 
- Refer to #Use case - 2 in [QuotesAPITest.java](./src\test\java\com\mastercard\crossborder\api\QuotesAPITest.java) for details.  

> Case 3:  **REVERSE QUOTE**
- Originating institute (OI) can initiate the request for reverse quote.  
- In this case of reverse quote, OI needs to ensure the beneficiary receives a specific amount in beneficiary currency. Quotes response will provide the amount to be transferred by OI.
e.g. If OI specifies beneficiary should receive 1000 INR(assuming beneficiary's currency is INR) as a fixed amount, OI will be asked to pay conversion of 1000 INR + fees as a quotes response.
- Refer to #Usecase - 3 in [QuotesAPITest.java](./src\test\java\com\mastercard\crossborder\api\QuotesAPITest.java) for details.

- [Retrieve Request](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/retrieve-request-api/) (HTTP GET)

### Implementation details for cross-border APIs that support encryption

Cross border APIs support JWE encryption. To develop an application that uses cross border APIs with encryption, below steps are to be followed.

**Step1**: HttpHeaders should have the parameter "x-encrypted" = "true".

**Step2**: You can encrypt the request payload by calling EncryptionUtils.jweEncrypt(). Parameters required for encryption are fingerPrint key and certificate (.crt) file. For more information on encryption keys, contact mastercard support team.

**Step3**: Wrap encrypted input in below format.
           
    For XML              
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <encrypted_payload>
        <data>encryptedPayloadAsAString</data>
    </encrypted_payload>   
    
    For JSON            
    {
      "encrypted_payload": { "data": "encryptedPayloadAsAString" }
    }      

**Step4**: Make an API call Pass with this encrypted request entity and you will get the encrypted response.

**Step5**: You can decrypt the response by calling EncryptionUtils.jweDecrypt(). Parameters required for decryption are key (.key) file. For more information on decryption keys, contact mastercard support team. There are multiple ways of decrypting a response. Reference implementation talks about only one type of decryption. Please refer https://developer.mastercard.com/page/generate-the-private-and-public-key-for-use-with-sdk-for-authorization-api for more details.

To understand implementation details of encryption and decryption, you can refer to makePaymentWithEncryption() in [RemittanceAPI.java](./src\test\java\com\mastercard\crossborder\api\RemittanceAPITest.java).
